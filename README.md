# Project Title : Fake vs Real Job Posting Analysis

  With ease of access to technologies, the number of jobs and number of job applicants have been significantly increasing in recent years. With this comes fraudulent techniques which misuses the dire situation of applicants by stealing their data for their malicious uses. We are aiming at developing a model to find fake job postings from groups of job postings. The data is provided by The University of the Aegean. This can help a number of job seekers to avoid the fake job postings which can actually expose their personal details in unsafe hands.
